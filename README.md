# Verdant

**Fighting urban heat islands through data-driven green infrastructure planning.**

Cities are heating up. Urban areas experience temperatures 5-10°C higher than surrounding rural regions, creating dangerous conditions for millions of residents. Vulnerable communities suffer most—facing higher energy costs, increased health risks, and degraded quality of life.

**Verdant empowers cities to fight back with actionable climate intelligence.**

## Our Mission

We believe every city deserves the tools to build a cooler, greener future. Verdant transforms complex satellite and sensor data into clear recommendations for where to plant trees, build parks, install green roofs, and implement cooling infrastructure. Verdant strives to help communities choose the best areas to build infrastructure to reduce environmental degradation and the effect of climate change.

**The goal is simple:** reduce urban temperatures, protect vulnerable populations, and make cities livable for generations to come.

## What Verdant Does

- **Visualizes heat patterns** across Canadian cities using satellite thermal data
- **Identifies hotspots** where residents face the greatest heat exposure
- **Recommends green infrastructure** with projected cooling effects and cost estimates
- **Tracks progress** with historical temperature trends and impact projections
